To Do List / Change Log

0.1 (09 Feb 2014) - Initial Commit
  - Show cluster summary state - nodes, volumes and brick up/down state
  - show summary information per volume - brick up/down count, volume type, 
    volume status and usable capacity summary
  - show errors discovered in summary list at the end of the output

0.2 Planned
  - align volume state text with nagios monitoring project


Items being considered
- from the vol status X detail output
  - record and show the nfs daemon states across the nodes 
  - record and show the self-heal states across the nodes


Known BUGS
- invocation after a node down event will block vol status. This needs to be 
  detected and the run aborted to prevent the wrong information being shown to
  the user
